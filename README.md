# Frontend (React.js + TailwindCSS):

Add, update, delete, and mark tasks as completed.

Responsive UI with a simple task list.

✅ Uses FormData for structured input handling.

✅ Automatically resets the form after submission.

✅ Keeps the logic clean by handling the event through the form.

✅ Uses the name attribute in the <input> field to retrieve form data.

✅ Form validation: Prevents empty or too-short task names.

✅ Error handling: Shows messages for failed operations.

✅ Auto-clears errors on successful submission.

✅ Edit Feature: Users can click "Edit", modify the text, and save changes.

✅ Inline Input for Editing: Tasks are edited in place without navigating to another page.

✅ Cancel Editing: Users can discard changes by clicking "Cancel".

✅ Error Handling: Catches API failures and displays appropriate messages.

This makes the app more user-friendly and prevents bad data from being submitted
